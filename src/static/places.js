      "Meeks' Honey began in 1971 when David Meeks purchased eleven dilapidated beehives from a neighbor in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Facing numerous problems and failing equipment was not a discouragement to David but a challenge. Out of that challenge grew 600 hives that David built into the base of his honey and pollination business. David loved his bees, and we are proud to still know the exact location of many of those hives.",

      "Following David Meeks' passing in 1991, the widowed Alayne Meeks could no longer run the business alone and decided to shift to marketing honey, which was more manageable. Carrying David's legacy, Meeks' Honey still works very closely with the many beekepers that David met through the business. We have maintained contact with the same farms and orchards that we moved the bees to following his passing.",
